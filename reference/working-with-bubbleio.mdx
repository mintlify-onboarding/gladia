description: "Bubble.io is a no-code development platform that allows users to create web applications without writing code."

It follows a visual programming approach, enabling users to design and build web apps through a drag-and-drop interface.

One of the powerful features of Bubble.io is its ability to connect with external APIs through API connectors. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.

Here's how API connectors work with Bubble.io:

1. **API Integration:** Bubble.io allows users to connect their web applications to external services and data sources by creating API connectors. These connectors act as bridges that enable data exchange between Bubble.io and external services like Gladia's Speech-To-Text API.
2. **Setting Up API Connectors:** Users can add API connectors by providing API endpoints, keys, and authentication details. These connectors act as interfaces to send and receive data between Bubble.io and the external APIs.
3. **Data Interaction:** users can use visual workflows and actions to interact with the external APIs once the API connectors are set up. This allows them to send data to the API to retrieve information or perform actions on the external services.
4. **Data Display and Usage:** After fetching data from the API, users can display it on their Bubble.io web application to populate data in various elements like repeating groups, charts, or dynamic text elements. Users can also send data back to the API to update information or trigger actions on the external service.
