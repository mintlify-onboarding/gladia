This introduction provides an overview of some basic concepts to ensure that you have a solid understanding of what our API offers. 

### Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is the technology that underpins the conversion of spoken language into written text. At its core, ASR systems take audio input, process the sound waves, and use complex algorithms to recognize the speech and output it as text. This technology has numerous applications such as transcription services, voice assistants, and many more. Gladia's Transcription API utilizes state-of-the-art ASR technology to ensure high accuracy and efficiency in transcribing audio.

### Speaker Diarization

Speaker Diarization is a process that segments an audio stream into homogenous regions according to the speaker identity. In simpler terms, it is the process of attributing portions of audio to different speakers. This is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple speakers are involved, such as in meetings, interviews, or podcasts. By knowing who said what, the transcriptions become much more informative and valuable. Gladia's Transcription API supports speaker diarization, enabling you to identify individual speakers within the audio stream.
